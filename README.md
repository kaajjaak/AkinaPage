# Akina Page

This is my personal website project that I made in order to learn and experiment with Next.js and React for the first time.



## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/kaajjaak/AkinaPage.git`

2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`

3. Start the development server
`npm run dev`

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

This website can be easily deployed to a static hosting platform such as Vercel or to a cloud platform like Heroku.
